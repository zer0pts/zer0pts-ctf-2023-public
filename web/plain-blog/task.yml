    I made a blog service consists of two servers: API server and Frontend server. The former provides APIs that you can see, add, or modify posts. The latter uses responses from API server and render it.<br>
    If you could get 1,000,000,000,000 likes on your post, I will give you the flag. The maximum number of likes is 5,000, though.<br>
    API server: <a href="http://plain-blog.2023.zer0pts.com:8400/" target="_blank">http://plain-blog.2023.zer0pts.com:8400/</a><br>
    Frontend server: <a href="http://plain-blog.2023.zer0pts.com:8401/" target="_blank">http://plain-blog.2023.zer0pts.com:8401/</a>
